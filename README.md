# Microcontrollers_for_Mechatronics
Concordia course for microcontrollers and their application to mechatronic systems. Topics to be studied include microcontroller hardware, microcontroller software development (in C++ and assembly), and related topics in mechatronics (actuators, sensors, design, control algorithms, etc.). The course provides hands-on experience in the form of controller development and microcontroller implementation for a realistic mechatronic system.

LECTURE TOPICS:

	
Introduction: 	microcontrollers and mechatronic systems 	
 	
Microcontroller 	architecture: ATmega328P microcontroller and development tools
 	
C++ and 	assembly language programming for microcontrollers
 	
Mechatronics
 	
Computer 	control
 	
Modelling 	and simulation
 	
Digital 	input and output (parallel I/O, serial I/O)
 	
Data 	conversion (analog input / ADC, analog output / DAC)
 	
Timers and 	interrupts
 	
Communication 	(SPI, I2C, wireless)
 	
Additional 	topics (digital control, robotics, networking, etc.) 	


COURSE LEARNING Outcomes (CLOs)
Upon successful completion of MECH 471, the students will be able to:
	
Develop 	and implement register level C++ microcontroller programs for 	mechatronics applications.
 	
Use 	C++ techniques for register level programming including bit 	operators, bit fields, unions, pointers, shared memory, static 	variables, volatile variables, and different number systems.
 	
Understand 	and use hardware including actuators, sensors, microcontrollers, 	DIO, ADC, DAC, timers, PWM, encoders, I2C, SPI, filters, amplifiers, 	Bluetooth, and Xbee.
 	
Understand 	and use programming techniques for microcontrollers including port 	I/O, clocks, timers, timer interrupts, external interrupts, 	interrupt priority, inter-process communication, shared memory, and 	atomic access.
 	
Test 	and debug microcontroller / mechatronics programs using compiler 	tools.
 	
Apply 	the topics above to develop microcontroller systems and C++ software 	for mechatronics applications including autonomous vehicle systems.
